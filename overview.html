Data layer for movie information.
<p>
    This Android project is a back-end API for movie information for an Android app. Modules are
    split up by data type (movies, users, tickets, etc.) with a root module, base, that provides
    resources used across multiple modules.
</p>
<h1>Base</h1>
<p>
    The base module is typically inherited by all modules, whether directly or transitively, and
    contains common resources.
</p>
<h1>Movies</h1>
<p>
    The movies module is the main module of the data layer and provides movie information.
